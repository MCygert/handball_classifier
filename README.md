# handball_classifier

## Main purpose
It's should count all statistics for
- passes
- shots 
- intercepts

## Plan how to implement it

 - [ x ] Fetch data of few games
 - [ x ] Split into single actions mentioned earlier
 - [ ] Create dataSet
 - [ ] Create dataloader
 - [ ] Create transformation for data
 - [ ] Use fine tuning from ImageNet
 - [ ] Create model
 - [ ] Train CRNN 
 - [ ] Validate on test data
 
 
 ## For future.
 - [ ] Validate on full game
 - [ ] Deploy as app or website
