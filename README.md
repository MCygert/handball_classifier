# handball_classifier

## Tensorflow
Project should be able to classify action's from video. Like:
- passes
- shots
- saves

### Implementation
It was implemented with CNN - LSTM architecture. First all videos are passed to CNN which is pretrained InceptionV3
And after getting features it's passed to recurrent unit - LSTM.
I have gathered data and labeled it by myself.

### Conclusion of project
I have very little data and probably biggest influence in performance has bad distribution of data -> a lot of passes but not so much of saves.



### Things which I would like to try with this project
1. Use different model like Video transformers -> [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.15691)
2. Create better dataset loader -> [Data api](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/data_performance)
3. Try saving CNN features to files so I won't have to run them every time.
4. Create confusion matrix of results.
5. Structure project into separate files so it will be more clean

## Pytorch -> I stopped learning Pytorch and changed to tensorflow but I will leave here the progress I made
### Main purpose

It's should count all statistics for

- passes
- shots
- intercepts

### Plan how to implement it

- [x] Fetch data of few games
- [x] Split into single actions mentioned earlier
- [x] Create dataSet
- [x] Create dataloader
- [x] Create transformation for data
- [x] [WIP] Create CNN
- [x] Create train loop
- [ ] Add some sort of checking how model is working
- [ ] Create CRNN -> CNN LSTM (Long short time memory)
- [ ] Train CRNN
- [ ] Validate on test data

### For future.

- [ ] Use fine-tuning from ImageNet
- [ ] Do some hyperparameter research
- [ ] Validate on full game
- [ ] Check different models
- [ ] Try make loading frames more efficient
- [ ] Maybe use same cache for videos
- [ ] Deploy as app or website
